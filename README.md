analysis.R is contains all the code used for the research project.

It is split into the following sections. Some sections require files as input, and sometimes analysis decisions were made based on descriptive graphs of the data. I.e. the code isn't designed to run from beginning to end non-stop & will probably need adapting to different datasets.

Contents:
1. Identify a list CRC symptoms
2. Find UKBB participants with symptoms and make a table of earliest symptom for each participant
3. Find earliest occurence of CRC for participants (identify cases & controls)
